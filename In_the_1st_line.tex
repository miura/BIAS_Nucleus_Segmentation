In the 1st line, we split the multichannel stack to do processing individually. Resulting image window names are specific to the source image name we used for the recording and this specific name is used in the second and the third line:  We have encounterd such non-general codes already and we know how to deal with this - construct image window names after splitting and also acquire their image IDs. We could use the code we wrote already in the section ``Splitting Channels''.
